LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
What did we learn?
- How to organise and structure data tables and establish relationships between them.

How did we work?
- We looked at websites offering similar services (ex: Tripadvisor), brainstormed the type of preferences a person from customer profile would have, analysed the type of data we wished to store and schematised the needed fields and structure on paper. Then we visualised it through Lucidchart, reviewed the structure and relationships until we found the most easy to understand and optimised way of organizing the data. 

What did we find difficult, easy or interesting?
- D_The lack of information about the available data.
- D_Establishing optimised and accurate relationships between the tables

What next steps were identified during the process?
- We need more data about the customer to be able to develop a more tailored profile for her and offer more personalised suggestions
